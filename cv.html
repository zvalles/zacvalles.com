                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>M.S. Aerospace Engineering, University of Michigan 2022</p>
                    <p>B.S. Mechanical Engineering, University of California Riverside, 2020</p>
                    <h3>Tesla - 2022 to Present</h3>
                    <p>Presently leading the development of a key chassis subsystem for a future vehicle program at Tesla that integrates battery storage and actuators while functioning as a critical structural member in the vehicle. I drive innovation at each level of production of the subsystem: mechanical design, integration of dozens of interfaces, high pressure die cast process optimization, physics simulations of fatigue and vibration performance, packaging design, integration and assembly into the factory line, and ergonomics of servicing the vehicle. 
                        The rest of my work is spent creating next generation isolation systems for existing and future vehicle platforms. Previously, I designed powertrain housings both future programs and Cybertruck, using advanced simulations to optimize stiffness, durability, and noise reduction. I established Tesla’s first underside abuse testing standard for Cybertruck and resolved a critical drivetrain seal issue, now in production at 400k units yearly.</p>
                    <h3>Marine Hydrodynamics Lab, University of Michigan - 2021 - 2022</h3>
                    <p>During my graduate research, I developed a hydroelastic modeling framework to predict cavitating and ventilating flow dynamics in real-time wave conditions. I led experimental campaigns on a superventilating hydrofoil at the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory, co-authoring three peer-reviewed papers published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.</p>
                    <h3>SpaceX - Summer 2020, 2021</h3>
                    <p>On the Propulsion team at SpaceX, I developed structural-thermal models for the Raptor engine, contributing to a successful hot fire test, and analyzed fatigue life in high-pressure lines. My simulations and load models improved actuator reliability and engine performance. I also worked at Starlink where I designed and installed a 2-ton steel gantry system for satellite solar array testing and built a thermal bakeout chamber for Starlink’s pilot factory line. My work supported critical testing and production milestones in SpaceX’s satellite program.</p>
                    <h3>Astranis - Fall 2019</h3>
                    <p>I led the mechanical design and qualification of the star tracker system, which is now in orbit. I also developed a custom thermal management system using heat pumps, copper heat straps, and radiators to ensure reliable performance in extreme space environments. My work helped enhance the structural and thermal stability of Astranis' satellite technology.</p>
                    <h3>Rivian - Summer 2019</h3>
                    <p>At Rivian, I focused on improving gearbox bearing performance and reliability, modeling temperature-induced preload fluctuations and testing alignment across temperature ranges. My work defined safe operating temperature ranges for optimal bearing life, contributing to the advancement of electric drivetrain durability.</p>
                    <h3>NASA JPL - 2018 to 2019</h3>
                    <p>I was a student researcher at NASA JPL in 2018 working on the design, fabrication, and testing of a high-frequency piezoelectric drill optimized for autonomous robotic drilling applications. My research findings were published in SPIE Smart Structures and NDE Symposia, showcasing my contributions to space exploration technologies.</p>
