                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>MS, Aerospace Engineering, University of Michigan 2022</p>
                    <p>BS, Mechanical Engineering, University of California Riverside, 2020</p>
                    <h3>Tesla</h3>
                    <p>Coming from a background of structural thermal analysis, I spent the first year at Tesla using this skillset to cut mass and improve reliability of drive unit cases. I then pivoted to work on minimizing vibration transmission of drive units across multiple vehicle platforms, working on both the modeling and design of the attentuation systems for these vibrations. I continue to work on these vibrational problems, but focus on the design of engineering automation tools for the design of new vibration isolators. I also own a large high pressure die cast part that is critical for vehicle durability and vibrational response from the wheels, drive unit, and thermal systems.</p>
                    <h3>SpaceX</h3>
                    <p>During my time as an Associate Propulsion Analyst and Design Engineer (2020 - 2021), I conducted advanced analyses on the torque vectoring system, predicting critical buckling loads through nonlinear materials analysis. I also worked on crack fatigue growth predictions for high-pressure engine lines under random vibration loading.</p>
                    <h3>Astranis</h3>
                    <p>As a Mechanical Design Intern in 2019, I developed flight hardware for Astranis's first production satellite, Arcturus 1. I focused specifically on the Star Tracker system, a critical component for satellite navigation and control.</p>
                    <h3>Marine Hydrodynamics Lab, University of Michigan</h3>
                    <p>As a Research Assistant (2021-2022), I led hydrodynamic research on cavitating and ventilating hydrofoils. This work resulted in co-authorship of three papers on surface-piercing hydrofoil modeling and control. I also supervised a test program for a surface-piercing hydrofoil, managing a team of three researchers.</p>
