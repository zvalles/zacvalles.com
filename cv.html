                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>MS, Aerospace Engineering, University of Michigan 2022</p>
                    <p>BS, Mechanical Engineering, University of California Riverside, 2020</p>
                    <h3>Tesla - 2022 to Present</h3>
                    <p>I lead the end-to-end development of a critical Robotaxi chassis subsystem, integrating actuator-driven and battery storage components while collaborating across integration, analysis, production, and service teams. By consolidating four chassis components into one, I achieved $150M in CapEx savings and reduced per-vehicle costs by $50M annually. I also spearheaded the industry’s first frequency-dependent damping powertrain vibration isolator, now being produced at a multi-million-unit scale for Robotaxi, Roadster, and Cybertruck. I also led the structural design of Robotaxi and Cybertruck powertrain housings, using CAE-driven topology optimization to meet stiffness, durability, and noise reduction targets. I established Tesla’s first powertrain underside abuse testing standard, designing a custom test rig to validate Cybertruck performance. Additionally, I conducted a failure analysis and redesign of a critical drivetrain seal, which is now produced at 400,000 units annually, improving reliability across Tesla’s vehicle lineup.</p>
                    <h3>Marine Hydrodynamics Lab, University of Michigan - 2021 - 2022</h3>
                    <p>During my graduate research, I developed a hydroelastic modeling framework to predict cavitating and ventilating flow dynamics in real-time wave conditions. I led experimental campaigns on a superventilating hydrofoil at the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory, co-authoring three peer-reviewed papers published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.</p>
                    <h3>SpaceX - Summer 2020, 2021</h3>
                    <p>At SpaceX, I designed and installed a 2-ton capacity steel gantry system for solar array deployment testing. I also developed a thermal bakeout chamber to remove moisture from satellite antennas, improving manufacturing reliability. My work supported SpaceX’s push toward more robust and efficient satellite testing and production. I also developed nonlinear structural-thermal FEA models for the Raptor engine, simulating housing failures and collaborating with the design team to implement improvements that led to a successful hot fire test. I also created thrust vector control dynamics models, conducted buckling analysis, and determined safe operating loads for actuator reliability. Additionally, I analyzed fatigue life in high-pressure engine lines, ensuring their durability under extreme conditions.</p>
                    <h3>Astranis - Fall 2019</h3>
                    <p>I led the mechanical design and qualification of the star tracker system, which is now in orbit. I also developed a custom thermal management system using heat pumps, copper heat straps, and radiators to ensure reliable performance in extreme space environments. My work helped enhance the structural and thermal stability of Astranis' satellite technology.</p>
                    <h3>Rivian - Summer 2019</h3>
                    <p>At Rivian, I focused on improving gearbox bearing performance and reliability, modeling temperature-induced preload fluctuations and testing alignment across temperature ranges. My work defined safe operating temperature ranges for optimal bearing life, contributing to the advancement of electric drivetrain durability.</p>
                    <h3>NASA JPL - 2018 to 2019</h3>
                    <p>I was a student researcher at NASA JPL in 2018 working on the design, fabrication, and testing of a high-frequency piezoelectric drill optimized for autonomous robotic drilling applications. My research findings were published in SPIE Smart Structures and NDE Symposia, showcasing my contributions to space exploration technologies.</p>
