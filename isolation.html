<h3> Context: </h3>
<p> 

I have worked on drive unit bushing design for the past three years and have launched several of these parts to production. In this post, I will peel back the layers on what it takes to stay at the forefront of keeping the cabins of electric vehicles quiet, at least from a powertrain noise perspective. 
    
<h3>Starting from the basics: </h3>
If you envision a mass being swung on a string that’s attached to a structure, starting from 1 revolution per second (1Hz) and sweeping up to 6,000 revolutions per second (6kHz), this is essentially what is happening in an EV powertrain in multiple locations. At some frequency range, you could put your hand on the structure and feel vibrations (0 to ~1000Hz), then, depending on the structure, you would begin to hear noise at the same time as feeling vibrations (1000 to 2000Hz), and after this you would cease to feel vibrations and instead only hear noise (2000 to 6000Hz).  The science behind this is complex but deals with concepts of structural dynamics, damping, and acoustic radiation — the tldr is that we can discriminate between noise, harshness, and vibrations (NVH, as we refer to in the automotive world) by frequency. 

<h3>In an electric vehicle powertrain, there are three main sources of noise/vibrations: </h3>
<p>
<u>Motor noise:</u> An electric motor uses permanent magnets or induced currents (induction) to generate torque. These rotors generate torque via different physics principles and have different sound profiles, but the important concept to note is that both rotor types impart oscillatory forces on the stator housing which lead to rotor-based vibrations that increase in frequency with the rotor speed. In the mass-on-spring analogy, motor NVH generally tends to be on the vibration-harshness (0-2000Hz) end of the NVH spectrum.</p>
    
<p> 
<u>Gear noise:</u> Outside of “direct drive” applications where the electric motor attaches directly to the wheels (in practice, 
inefficient to do so), electric motors interface to the wheels through a gear reduction system, which are typically done in stages where a small, faster spinning gear interfaces with a larger, slower spinning gear — trading speed (which electric motors have too much of and wheels don’t need a lot of) for torque (which wheels need a lot of and motors don’t have a lot of). Obscuring some of the context of gear selection, most electric vehicles are optimized to be highly efficient but also comfortable, thus helical cut gears are typically favored over spur cut gears for the efficiency to noise tradeoff ratio (helical = slight efficiency penalty, huge noise reduction). As the force transfers between the smaller to larger gear through the teeth, the tooth deflects momentarily before springing back as they come out of mesh, driving a force fluctuation through both the shaft and drive unit housing which, depending on the frequency of this oscillation, results in the generation of noise/vibrations. </p>
<p>
<u>Inverter noise:</u> I won’t spend much time talking about this because this is not something I spend a lot of time working on, but the inverter generates strong magnetic fields that flip back and forth, and these magnetic fields interact with inverter components to generate small amplitude but very high frequency vibrations. These frequencies start at around ~2kHz, and reach up to 20kHz, so they are almost exclusively airborne noise that cannot be “filtered out” via a vibration isolation system, and in practice have to damped out with “NVH covers” that are essentially thick foam acoustic isolation. </p>
<p>
<u>Alternative forms of noise:</u> There are many other noises associated with drive units, but the highest in prominence are listed above. Essentially anything moving (bearings, shafts, even lubrication sloshing inside the drive unit) generates noise. However, the primary drivers of customer experience come from the motor, gears, and inverter. </p>
        
<h3>The source, the transfer path, and the role of an isolator: </h3>
We discussed the sources: motor noise, gear noise, and inverter noise. In the words of an NVH engineer <i>“1g of mass at the source is worth 1kg at the receiver”</i>. Solving problem at the source level have leverage compared to solving the problems along the transfer path or at the isolator, but all are required to achieve good isolation performance. What this looks like at a finer level are adjustments made to gear microgeometry profiles that reduce tooth deflection, but this must be optimized in tandem with gear tooth durability, tooth wear, and bearing reliability. At the motor level, control strategies to improve the stator deformation behavior are implemented that result in lower deflection amplitudes, again coming at a balance with thermal and electromagnetic performance metrics. There are well defined limits to source improvements, and system level trade-offs with efficiency and performance are made depending on the product requirements.  

The “transfer path” refers to the path the vibration propagates through to reach the customer, perceived as tactile vibration felt in the steering wheel, in the seat, at any touch points in the cabin or heard as airborne noise. The transfer path can be divided into the “active side” and the “passive side”. In the automotive context, the active side refers to the gears, motor, and drive unit structure while the passive side refers to the chassis/body into the cabin. The isolator refers to an elastomeric component that serves as an energy barrier between the source and the receiver. 

The key performance metric for an isolator can be defined with the transmissibility ratio (TR) which is a function of the mobilities (defined as the velocity response of a point to an applied force) of the receiver, isolator, and source. The basic physics involved here can be summarized with the following equation: 
        
TR = abs[(Y_receiver + Y_source)/(Y_isolator + Y_receiver + Y_source)]

Mobility is inversely proportionate to the dynamic stiffness of a structure, so effective isolation is essentially a minimization of the bushing to total structure (source stiffness + receiver) dynamic stiffness for any given frequency, which lays out the principles of good isolator design.

<h3>Nuances of EV Powertrain Isolation:</h3>

For a given source, we know the most effective isolation (lowest noise perceived in the cabin) results from minimizing the ratio of bushing stiffness to structure stiffness at every frequency. At a static level, we have to account for the fact that vibrations of the drive unit happen as a result of the drive unit generating torque which is reacted by the isolator — so the isolator performance must be evaluated under a specific preload. 
<p>At a dynamic level, things get much more interesting.  </p>
        
<ul>
  <li>The structures in the active (DU - source) and passive (body- receiver) side have frequency dependent responses. Hence, if we had a constant amplitude source excitation and swept it across a frequency range, we would feel/hear more as we passed by modes of the structure. In practice, we can identify these active and passive side structural mode frequencies and tune the frequencies by some amount by adding stiffness and mass, but cannot eliminate them.</li>
  <li>The source (gears and motor excitations) sweep across frequencies, but have higher or lower amplitudes dependent on the gear microgeometry and motor architecture.</li>
  <li>The isolator also has a frequency dependent response caused by resonance of the elastomer which can be tuned with durometer changes to the rubber and amplitude with tuned-mass damper concepts that offset the peak of the dynamic stiffness curve. A critical note here is that preload dramatically influences the dynamic stiffness of the isolator, so these curves must be evaluated under the preload in which the vehicle NVH is being considered.</li>
</ul>

Through dynamic stiffness analysis of the active side, passive side and isolator we can begin to construct at what frequency ranges effective isolation is lost due to the frequency dependency of the source, the transfer path, and the isolator. 

<h3>What Makes NVH Design Extra Difficult:</h3>

If drive unit NVH were measured in a vacuum, this optimization would be tricky, but solvable with enough maturity of the design — however noise and vibration signals are measured in vehicles that are also experiencing noise and vibration from the tires, the wind, the HVAC system, and the suspension system. 
    
This intertwines the drive unit NVH performance with the NVH performance of the full vehicle, which is why in discussion of powertrain noises, all other noises are referred to as “masking noise”. There are frequency ranges where drive unit noise is imperceptible due to amplified aerodynamic or wheel-based noise that radiates through the cabin, however in some driving conditions at lower speeds, drive unit noise is perceivable and has a far higher NVH performance requirement. 

To add further complexity, if you make 10,000 drive units and measure the sound profile across a torque and frequency range, the deviations in gear specifications result in shaft misalignment and tooth error, coupled with the build consistency of the vehicle (the transfer path), result in a measurable spread in noise. This is protected for in practice by setting some upper limits on what is acceptable NVH, by measuring the drive units rolling off the production line directly and rejecting limit samples. </p>

To top it all off, sound profiles themselves are subjective in assessment. Some people find joy in hearing the high pitched, spaceship-esque sounds of the drive unit while another daily driver might take offense. This drives the requirements for NVH to be created with prototypes and subjective test rides, where drive conditions are assessed and pass or fail which then informs the subsequent design iterations.</p>
