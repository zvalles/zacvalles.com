        <h1>Zac Valles</h1>
        <p>I studied aerospace engineering at UMichigan and spent some time there researching fluid mechanics to build supercavitating hydrofoils and torpedos. Before that, I studied mechanical engineering at UCR where a few friends and myself developed <a href="https://www.highlanderracing.org/hr19-e">one of the first AWD electric vehicle's</a> in the North American Formula SAE competition.<p> 
        <p>Currently I work at Tesla on the powertrain engineering team. I recently delivered the production design for the second largest casting on Robotaxi <a href="https://service.tesla.com/docs/Cybertruck/ServiceManual/en-us/GUID-5074F54D-7874-4C49-8C4F-A7B8BE78F68A-online-en-US.jpg">similar to this</a> and drive unit bushings <a href="https://service.tesla.com/docs/ModelS/ServiceManual/Palladium/en-us/GUID-B3AEC9C9-2B48-498E-826F-64F5D33ADFEE-online-en-US.jpg">similar to this</a>. Currently, I am working on building innovative engineering automation tools that take advantage of advances in machine learning to ramp future iteration speed of the parts I have been responsible for previously. 

 I love to build. From consumer products that emphasize design vision and consumer experience to solving hard physics problems that take are combined heat transfer, material science, and structural mechanics challenges, I love to build.</p>
        <p>I made this website to document my career, personal projects, and writings about life which you'll find below.</p>
